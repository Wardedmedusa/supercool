            Food Poisoning
        </h2>
        <p>
            Some people believe that the dancing could have been caused by food poisoning caused by the toxic
            and psychoactive chemical products of ergot fungi.<br>
            To put it in simpler terms the dancing plague could have been a bunch of people getting really
            high of shrooms then having a 7 week long, deadly, 16th century rave. <br>
            This is my personal favourite theory.

        <h2>
            Stress-induced mass hysteria
        </h2>
        <p>
            This could have been an example of psychogenic movement disorder occurring in mass hysteria or mass psychogenic illness. 
            This involves many individuals suddenly exhibiting the same bizarre behavior. 
            This can be caused by high levels of psychological stress, which in this case could have been caused by the starvation and disease present in the region at the time. 
            Basically, people got so stressed that their bodies decided to start uncontrollably dancing until they died. 
            I don't know what kind of twisted fight-or-flight response that is, but I hope it never happens to me
