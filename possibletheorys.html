            Food Poisoning
        </h2>
        <p>
            Some people believe that the dancing could have been caused by food poisoning caused by the toxic
            and psychoactive chemical products of ergot fungi.<br>
            To put it in simplier terms the dancing plague could have been a bunch of people getting really
            high of shrooms then having a 7 week long, deadly, 16th century rave. <br>
            This is my personal favourite theory.

        <h2>
            Stress-induced mass hysteria
        </h2>
        <p>
            This could have been an example of psychogenic movement disorder happening in mass hysteria or mass psychogenic illness.
            This involves many individuals suddenly exhibiting the same bizarre behaviour. This can be caused by high levels of psychological stress.
            This high level of stress could have been caused by the starvation and disease that was present in the region at the time.<br>
            Basically people got so stressed that their body decided to start uncontrollably dancing till they died.
            I don't know what kind of twisted fight or flight response that is but I hope it never happens to me.
